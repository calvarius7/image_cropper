#### **Image.tiff Cropper**

This tool crops every .tiff (or .tif) file in this folder recursive (every subfolder will also be searched). 

The cropped images will be put into a new `./cropped/` folder. 

Crop-Settings are found and can be changed in `image_cropper.properties`. 

_Minimum requirement is JAVA 11 JRE (for tiff support)._
